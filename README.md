### KPI's overview :

 #### (1). Total Loan Applications:  
 This is used to calculate the total number of loan applications  received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

 ###### Metric Calculation:
 
     Total Loan Applications = COUNT(bank_loan_data[id])

     MTD Loan Applications = CALCULATE(TOTALMTD([Total Loan Applications],'Date Table'[Date]))

     MOM Loan Application = ([MTD Loan Applications] - [PMTD Loan Applications])/[PMTD Loan Applications]
     where
     PMTD Loan Applications = CALCULATE([Total Loan Applications],DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date Table'[Date],-1,MONTH)))
####  (2). Total Funded Amount:
Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. Bank also want to keep an eye on the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.

 ###### Metric Calculation:
 
     Total Funded Amount = sum(bank_loan_data[loan_amount])

     MTD Funded Amount = CALCULATE(TOTALMTD([Total Funded Amount],'Date Table'[Date]))

     MOM Funded Amount = ([MTD Funded Amount] - [PMTD Total Funded Amount])/[PMTD Total Funded Amount]

     where
     PMTD Total Funded Amount = CALCULATE([Total Funded Amount],DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date Table'[Date],-1,MONTH)))
    
#### (3). Total Amount Received:
Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. Bank wants to analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

 ###### Metric Calculation:
 
     Total Amount Received = SUM(bank_loan_data[total_payment])

     MTD Amount Recieved = CALCULATE(TOTALMTD([Total Amount Received],'Date Table'[Date]))
     
     MOM Amount Recieved = ([MTD Amount Recieved] - [PMTD Amount Recieved])/[PMTD Amount Recieved]
     
     where
     PMTD Amount Recieved = CALCULATE([Total Amount Received],DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date Table'[Date],-1,MONTH)))
#### (4). Average Interest Rate: 
Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into bank lending portfolio's overall cost.

 ###### Metric Calculation:
 
     Avg Interest Rate = AVERAGE(bank_loan_data[int_rate])

     MTD Avg Interest Rate = CALCULATE(TOTALMTD([Avg Interest Rate],'Date Table'[Date])
     
     MOM Avg Interest Rate = ([MTD Avg Interest Rate] - [PMTD Avg Inerest Rate])/[PMTD Avg Inerest Rate]

     where
     PMTD Avg Inerest Rate = CALCULATE([Avg Interest Rate],DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date Table'[Date],-1,MONTH))))
 
#### (5). Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): 
Evaluating the average DTI for bank borrowers helps bank to gauge their financial health. Bank wants to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.

 ###### Metric Calculation:
 
     AVG DTI = AVERAGE(bank_loan_data[dti])

     MTD Avg DTI = CALCULATE(TOTALMTD([AVG DTI],'Date Table'[Date]))
     
     MOM DTI = ([MTD Avg DTI] - [PMTD Avg DTI])/[PMTD Avg DTI]

     where
     PMTD Avg DTI = CALCULATE([AVG DTI],DATESMTD(DATEADD('Date Table'[Date],-1,MONTH)))
    
### Overview tab :

I aim to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends using a variety of chart types. These charts will provide a clear and insightful view of bank lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling bank to gain valuable insights into various loan parameters

## Graphical representation of data:

### Good Loans issued:

<img width="440" alt="Goodloanissued" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eccdffc0-8e2a-45f7-9497-28dc4d11c2a2">



Loan is considerded good when loan status is 'Fully Paid' or 'Current'. This donut chart will track following metrics :


##### Good Loan Issued Percentage

     Good Loan % = (CALCULATE(bank_loan_data[Total Loan Applications],bank_loan_data[Good Vs Bad Loan]="Good Loan"))/bank_loan_data[Total Loan Applications]
   
     where
   
     [Good Vs Bad Loan] is group created by considering field loan_status. It has 2 members .

       1. "Good Loan"
       2. "Bad Loan"

       A loan is considered "Good Loan" if loan_status is "Current" or "Fully Paid"

       A loan is considered "Bad Loan" if loan_status is "Current" or "Charged Off"

##### Good Loan Applications

      Good Loan Applications = CALCULATE([Total Loan Applications],bank_loan_data[Good Vs Bad Loan] = "Good Loan")

##### Good Loan Funded Amount
