# Bank-Loan-Analysis-
In order to monitor and assess bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform bank lending strategies.
## Database and tools usage :
   Database : **`SQL Server`**
   
   Reporting tool : **`Power BI`**
